Freya Fenris

<p style="text-align: center;">
Thanks to *Star Wars Wiki*, I was able to learn a lot about **Freya Fenris**, a human female pilot who served with [Ace Squadron](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ace_Squadron). She seems like a serious person, hence the following quote.

Part 2: Cooking Recipe
======================

Obsessively Good Avocado Cucumber Salad
---------------------------------------

### Via Deb Perelman on *Smitten Kitchen*

Ingredients are as follows:

-   3/4 to 1 seedless cucumber
-   2 thin or 1 regular scallion
-   1 large avocado
-   2 tablespoons mayonaise
-   1/2 lime
-   salt
-   Sriracha
-   cilantro

Needed "special" kitchen tools:

-   two bowls
-   knife
-   avocado pitter (optional)

Steps of the recipe:

1.  Wash cucumbers and chop into chunks. Add to bowl.
2.  Wash scallion and slice it thinly. Add to bowl.
3.  Pit avocado and slice it thinly. Add to bowl.
4.  Whisk together mayo, lime, and seasonings in a separate bowl, adjusting levels to taste.
5.  Drizzle salad with dressing.
6.  Chop cilantro and add as garnish.
7.  Repeat again tomorrow.

<p style="text-align: center;">
A special season of the year for this recipe would be summer, because that is peak avocado season. There are many variations of this recipe. You could consider any of the below options in lieu of mayo:
</p>
-   Combine minced jalapeno, olive oil, and ground cumin.
-   Create a dressing of toasted sesame oil, miso, rice vingegar, and ginger.
-   Experiment! This relatively simple salad can be combined with many ingredients.

Euclidean Distance
==================

Via the wikipedia page for the formula
--------------------------------------

### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\displaystyle {\\overline{\\mathbf{p} \\mathbf{q}}}$). In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>,..., *p*<sub>n</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>,..., *q*<sub>n</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pytahgorean formula:

$$ \\begin{align\*} d(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q}) = d(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{p}) &= \\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2+ (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + \\cdots + (q\_n - p\_n)^2 } \\\\ 
&=  \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (q\_i - p\_i)^2}. \\end{align\*}  $$

The position of a point in Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tipps (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$ \\displaystyle \\lVert \\mathbf{p} \\rVert = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + \\cdots + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}},$$
 where the last expression involves the dot product.
